1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?

In a client-server architecture, the client initiates communication by sending requests, while the server listens for these requests and responds by providing the requested resources or services. In the HTTP protocol, the client, often a web browser, sends requests, and the server, typically a web server, responds with the requested data.
-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

 a "route" refers to a predefined path or endpoint on the server that is associated with a specific resource or functionality. It defines how the server should respond when a client (typically a web browser) makes a request to a particular URL.

app.get('/home', (req, res) => {
  // Code to handle requests to '/home'
  res.send('Welcome to the home page!');
});

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter

//solution

- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
